### The story of a self-taught developer

I was introduced to computers from a very young of 5 by my cousin who was a programmer. He taught me the basic functions done with a mouse and the window objects, i.e. how to click on the big red cross to close off a window and since then, I have been hooked on learning more and more of the functionalities that computers have to offer.

In my teenage years, I was the go-to fixer of computers in the family, however I did little to no coding. It was in my early 20s where I discovered Python programming when googling for automation strategies at my first ever job as a Buyer in London where there were many manual repetitive tasks. My knowledge and passion for Python programming grew the more I realised the power behind the beast! Soon after, I made a decision to learn programming through CodeCademy, a free online service for beginners like myself. This was an amazing experience, I felt like a little kid with an all brand spanking new toy to play with after work! During this time, I attended a few free General Assembly lectures of data science and web development, and this is where my passion shifted from Python, to Web Development Stacks such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

A few months after, I decided it was time to quit my current job, move back to my family home in Leeds to study web development full time. This was it, I had the chance to follow my passion/ hobby of programming in order to turn it into a serious career! I picked up the Zero-to-Mastery course on Udemy by Andrei Neagoie. Andrei is an amazing teacher who covered the basics of computer science all the way to advanced front and backend concepts. After the course I undertook the JS30 course as well as a few personal projects to further advanced my confidence at using the tools of web development.

Throughout my learnings, all of the tutors had recommended junior developers to create a [portfolio website](https://samraha.com) to showcase projects to recruiters, but more importantly; other devs. Therefore, for about 3 weeks, I worked on creating my own website using HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Bootstrap and Javascript. This was a very fun and awarding process as I was creating something from scratch, for myself. After completing my own website, I was offered to create a landing page for an official Leeds and Reading Festival band as freelance work. I swept up this opportunity and created [The Loose Cut](https://theloosecut.com).

For the past 6 months I have been studying programming full time, and whilst that still goes on in the background, I am now applying for full time developer jobs.
