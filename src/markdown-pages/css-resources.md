### CSS is beautiful

The below resources are one of my favourites for practicing CSS:

1. Mimic a website
> Practice trying to mimic an existing website such as facebook. This is a great way of understanding website design and layouts.
2. CSS Grid
>[Grid Garden](https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/) is a great tool that teaches you CSS Grid through a game.

3. CSS Flexbox
>Similar to Grid Garden, [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) is a great tool that teaches you CSS Flexbox through a game.
